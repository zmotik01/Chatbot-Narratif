C’était alors que Mimi, la grenouille, arriva au bord de la rivière, lourdement chargée de pattes de moules. Elle avait vu Leo dans son rêve la nuit dernière et savait qu’il était sans nourriture. Elle lâcha ses pattes de moules sur le sol et, avec un rire guttural, dit : \"Allez-y, manger si t’en as soif !\" Leo regarda Mimi et en fut étonné. Il avait tué des grenouilles et du bétail, mais jamais une grenouille ne lui avait rien donné. Il dévora ses moules et, après son repas, il dit à Mimi : \"Merci, Mimi. Tu es vraiment une amie.\" Et depuis ce jour, Leo et Mimi partageaient leurs repas. Ils étaient maintenant des amis pour toujours.'"
